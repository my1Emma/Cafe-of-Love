Narrator: You walk into this mysterious cafe, captivated by its welcoming exterior– as well as the scent of familiar sweets invading your nose from the outside.
Narrator: Looking around, you notice that the inside is just as beautifully decorated as the outside. The smell that led you into here was stronger as well, as expected.
Narrator: You notice a tall man behind the counter.
Narrator: He seems to be practicing what looks to be latte art.
???: Please, take a seat. I’ll be with you very shortly!
Narrator: The man took the time to acknowledge you while finishing up his latte art. 
Narrator: You did what he said and took a seat at one of the round tables in front of the counter. 
Narrator: You decide to take a look at the menu, each option sounding more delicious than the last. 
You: …
???: Anything that catches your eye?
You: !!!
You: (I guess I took longer to browse the menu than I thought…)
You: Uh- I’m just really overwhelmed because it all looks so good…
???: I see. In that case, I’ll prepare you a special blend customized just for you!
Narrator: The man walked to the counter and began looking at the shelf stocked with coffee beans.
You: (Special blend… I don’t see that anywhere on the menu?)
Narrator: You notice the man picking up the different coffee bean packages, thinking carefully before deciding one to use in his mysterious concoction.
???: Perfect!
Narrator: You curiously watch him as he makes his way toward the kitchen of the cafe.
Narrator: The cafe kitchen was obscured and you couldn’t look into it, so you wondered what exactly he was working on in there.
Narrator: Some of your questions are answered as you hear roaring from a machine coming from the kitchen. The machine was being turned on and off with a consistent pulse, followed by the removal of a lid, and tapping against glass.
Narrator: A while passes while waiting for him and you can only hear small, unsuspicious noises. 
Narrator: You soon see him exit the kitchen and approach you, placing a cup of coffee and glass bowl of crushed nuts on your table while simultaneously holding a bottle of caramel. 
Narrator: In this moment, you try to examine the appearance of the coffee but you are greeted with a frothy milk topping.
Narrator: He turns the bottle over and begins drizzling the sweet goo across the top of the drink. Afterwards, he picks up the glass bowl and sprinkles its contents on the drink. 
Narrator: He admires his work, before quickly focusing his attention on you.
???: Here you go! A special blend curated just for you~
You: (That was fairly quick…)
Narrator: You pick up the coffee in your left hand and take in the aroma of the drink. 
You: (It smells amazing, I can’t wait to drink this!)
Narrator: You take a sip of the coffee.
You: …
You: This is… amazing… What is this?
???: Ah! I’m glad you enjoy it~ It’s a special latte brewed with macadamia nuts and drizzled and topped with caramel. 
You: (Something so simple… yet so so delicious?!)
Narrator: You hear the shopkeeper’s bell ring and both of your attention turns toward it to see who entered.
Narrator: It was someone wearing the same uniform as the man who just served you this coffee, looking flustered and embarrassed.
???: I sincerely apologize for being LATE. I seem to have forgotten to set my alarm last night.
???: That's ok Tsukasa. Make sure to set your alarm next time to prevent it from happening again.
Tsukasa: Thank you for your kindness. I will work my very hardest today to make it up to you.
Tsukasa: Oh, is this a new customer, Tsumugi? I’ve never seen their face around here.
Tsumugi: You’re quite the observant one aren’t you?
Tsukasa: Well typically we tend to have the same customers come in everyday, so you get used to seeing them.
Tsumugi: Speaking of that, would you like a banana muffin to go with your drink? It’s on the house!
You: Yes, thank you so much!
Tsukasa: I’ll get on that right away, sir!
Narrator: The worker briskly walked behind the counter and into the kitchen.
Narrator: Yet another worker emerges from the kitchen and heads towards Tsumugi’s direction.
???: Hey boss- I just did inventory, here’s what I got. 
Tsumugi: Amazing, thank you so much Koga! 
Tsumugi: Oh- Koga, this is our newest customer. Make sure they feel right at home!
Koga: Ah excuse my poor manners, we don’t usually get new customers n’ all…
You: And why is that?
Koga: Well, this place is well hidden behind trees so it doesn’t attract a ton of attention aside from our usuals. How did you find this place?
You: Well…
You: I’m new to this town, so… I got lost and I saw this place and couldn’t resist myself!
You: I wanted to take some time to just relax before I start school at Yumenosaki Academy next week, when my registration is complete.
Koga: Didya just say Yumenosaki? I go there!
You: Really?!
Koga: Yeah, I’m a third year student.
Tsumugi: I graduated from there! Everyone who works here either attends or used to attend Yumenosaki, actually.
Koga: It’s a pretty big place so, maybe I could show you around once ya start?
You: That would be so helpful, thank you so much!
Narrator: The sound of the shopkeeper's bell once again, catches your attention. 
Narrator: You see two workers walking in mid-conversation, one of them holding a houseplant.
???: You can place that right there, thank you.
Tsumugi: What’s that, Shu?
Shu: Xerochrysum bracteatum. 
Tsumugi: …?
???: It’s also called golden everlasting, for simple terms. Or a strawflower. That's what my brother told me, at least.
Koga: Why’d ya bring it here though?
Shu: I’m not exactly sure as to why, but I feel an extreme connection with this plant. It spoke to me. I feel having it in the cafe will raise morale.
Tsumugi: Shu, you are one strange soul.
Shu: Nearly insulting coming from the likes of you.
Narrator: He sassily turned his head and walked away.
Tsumugi: Oh Shu, as sassy as usual…
Tsukasa: Here’s your muffin!
You: Oh, thank you so much!
Narrator: You attempted to reach for your coffee so that you could enjoy it with your muffin, but it seems you finished the drink without realizing…
Narrator: Everyone leaves you to enjoy the rest of your meal in peace and you take in your environment.
Narrator: After you’re done, you pay for your drink and go home.
You: (Everyone was so nice…)
You: (...)
Narrator: (Before you know it, your few days of freedom pass and you officially start school tomorrow morning…)
