# Cafe of Love - An Enstars Fan-made Dating Sim!

I created this dating sim using HTML, CSS, and Javascript! It was for my high school senior capstone project, where I was able to make any project so long as it showed what I learned throughout the years.
I was inspired by the "Ensemble Stars!!" shuffle unit [BLEND+](https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:BLEND%2B_(Unit)) and wanted to make an otome game based off it. 
**Currently, there is only one chapter that's playable** and I am taking a break from working on this project, but I would be open to continuing it in maybe Ren'Py or Unity!
## Future Plans
- Adding a function to clear the Dialogue History when going to the main menu
- ~~Actually finishing the sprites (sorry).~~
- Customizing a music player
- Making the credits screen... not a blank screen?
- Continuing in a game engine so I can add more complex features
## Credits (Because the credits screen in-game isn't done)
- "Smooth Lovin" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)
